# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

          tasking_manager:
            step_one_title: Choose a task
            step_one_legend: Tasks are the geographic area outlined for mapping in OpenStreetMap. Select tasks from the many campaigns on offer.  
            step_two_title: Select a square
            step_two_legend: Each task area is divided into small squares. When you select a square, it is locked so other users can’t map until you complete it or unlock it. 
            step_three_title: Start mapping roads
            step_three_legend: Use yearly satellite images to see when logging roads appear, trace them on the map, and tag them with the year that they appeared
            step_four_title: Look at images
            step_four_legend: You will see a selection of images from different years. Your job is to select the image where the road first appears.
            step_five_title: Select an image where you see roads
            step_five_legend: Once you see an image with a road, select it and it will be saved to the database.
            step_six_title: Keeping going!
            step_six_legend: After you make your selection, a new set of images will appear. The more you select the higher your score!

All around the world, our partners host mapathons and train users how to use OpenStreetMap tools to map logging roads. You learn how to use iD and Tasking manager, satellite imagery, as well as our partner’s amazing programs.
